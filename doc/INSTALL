OK, Install instructions... Hmmm

I am going to assume that you have some experience with MySql and with php. If you don't 
you are likely to have some difficulty. If you need help though, I am willing to do what
I can. However, I cannot really help with teaching you php, MySql or how you might interact
with your web host. In those areas you are on your own. 

Alright, lets get the database setup first:

First thing you need to do is update the schema that will be added to the database. In the 
setup directory there is a file called ltc_schema.sql. You will likely want to edit that 
file. All of the tables are prefixed with "LTC_PHX_". You will likely want or need to change 
that. So in your favorite editor do a replace-all for LTC_PHX_ to some other prefix and save 
the file.

Now create the database. Depending on where the database will be hosted how you do this varies.
If it is your laptop for testing then you will likely use a command line utility. If it is
hosted, you will need jump through their predefined hoops. This may be simple or complex
depending on your provider. Again, I am assuming that you know a little about what you are
doing here. In any event you need to create a database and you need to have credentials to
access the database. The sql file has some very basic steps documented at the top of it that 
work if you have root or administrative access to your MySql database.

Now, you need to execute the sql in your new database and once again the way you do 
that is completely dependent on where your MySql database is hosted. The command line means of
doing so are in the header of the sql file. At some point I may move all of this into php
and have everything done from there but for now this is how it is.

If you have succeeded in all of the above you have the following information:

db host     : ________________________

db user     : ________________________

db database : ________________________

db password : ________________________

db prefix   : ________________________

Whew! That was fun! Right? Ok, now on to the web site:

Copy the "registration" directory along with its sub-directories to your web server. 

copy the file "include/config.php.sample" to "include/config.php" and then edit the
config.php file. Using the information above update the file to represent your environment.

You should now be able to login. Just point your browser to wherever you uploaded the 
registration directory to and you should be ready to go. 

Userid: Admin
Password: DoDeut6:4-7

I STRONGLY suggest that after you login you create another administrative account with
a userid and password that only you know and delete the "Admin" account. There is nothing
special about it except that it is named Admin and the whole world knows the password.

At this point you should be fully up and operational. Please let me know if you have any 
issues because if *YOU* do than most like *I* will and I would just as soon fix it.

Other files and directories here in the download:

You will notice a Submissions and tshirt-judging directories in the download. These are not
required at all for the registration system. These are ancillary files that are useful in
collecting pre-convention events via an upload to Dropbox. The same for Senior information
so that they can be honored at closing ceremonies. The latter may be unique to our region. 
The former may or may not be useful to you based on how you collect pre-convention media.

The tshirt-judging is almost certainly unique to our region. We allow our kids to submit
tshirt designs and one of them is chosen go on the t-shirt for that year. This app is a
simple gallery app to allow the board members to judge and select the design to be used.
