Hello, if you are here you are either curious or are looking for something that 
you think this project may supply. Here is what you have found/stumbled across...

This is a registration system for the Leadership Training for Christ (LTC) youth 
mentoring program. (For more info on the organization take a look at http://ltcsw.org). 
This program is used by the Southwest region of the organization. It has most of 
the features that are needed to run a successful LTC convention.

  - Registration
  - Event Management
  - Event Coordinator Management
  - Participant Management
  - Room Management
  - Event scheduling and signup
  - Standard reports
  - Assignment of judges
  - Tally and awards Management
  - Extremely simplistic accounting
  - Extra T-Shirt ordering
  - Extra Meals ordering
  - And other duties as assigned

The program has served LTCSW for many years and every year it evolves. New features 
are added, old features augmented and bugs addressed. Often times updates are just 
to clean up the code. This was my inaugural php/mysql project many years ago and 
some areas of the code really show novice coding. The UI is very non-standard in 
some places and the overall visual design looks like it was conceived by an engineer 
without any graphical skills. There is a reason for that: It was. Newer code is much 
better but not as good as the code I will right later ... always improving :)

You are welcome to use the system as is, offer suggestions for improvement, offer 
updates, open issues or use it as a base for your own project or whatever. You just 
do so at your own risk. It has been know to eat kittens.
