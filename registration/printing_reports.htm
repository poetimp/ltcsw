   <h1>Printing Reports</h1>
   <p>The reports that are generated on this web site are designed to be
   printed. By far the easiest way to print is to simply select the report you
   are interested in and print the page from your browser. Sometimes, however,
   the formatting of the printed information is less than ideal. This is
   particularly true as it pertains to where the pages break.</p>
   <p>If you are wanting to have some control over page breaks, as well as other
   print formatting, there is a simple set of steps that you can follow to bring
   the report into your favorite word processor.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>First open the report you are interested in. For example &quot;<a target="_blank" href="RptWhoByEvent.php">Who
      is in what</a> (By Event)&quot; report. </li>
      <li>Once the report is displayed type <i>&lt;ctrl&gt;a</i> to select the whole
      report. (This is done by holding down the <i>&lt;ctrl&gt;</i> key and then
      pressing the letter &quot;<i>a</i>&quot;.) </li>
      <li>Next press <i>&lt;ctrl&gt;c</i> to copy the report. </li>
      <li>Then open your word processor and type <i>&lt;ctrl&gt;v</i> to paste the
      report into the word processor. </li>
      <li>Now you can add page breaks, reformat or whatever you would like to
      make it print the way you want it to. </li>
      <li>Page Breaks are added in most word
      processors by positioning your cursor at the beginning of the line you want to
      start on a new page and pressing<i>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</i>.</li>
   </ul>
